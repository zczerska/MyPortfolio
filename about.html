				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<h4>In a nutshell..</h4>
				<p>I am interested in the psychological underpinnings that guide people to make their decisions. I look at design through this lens. My innate curiousity has guided the choices that led me here. This is my journey:</p>

				<h4>How I got here:</h4>
				<p>I remember the moment that I first was able to fully grasp that other people were having different thoughts and feelings, on their own- not centered on me. </p>
				<p>True, I was a small child, but the theory of mind was overwhelming and exciting.  My interest in other people and their thoughts and feelings continued...</p>

				<h4>My next move:</h4>
				<p>I found a way to explore my interests in a program at Emory University where I studied neuroscience and behavioral biology. I was able to learn the answers to my questions from multiple angles: anthropology, ethology, neuroscience and psychology. How my studies evolved into my approach today:</p>

				<p>1. Primatology: through behavioral research, I learned to observe slight nuances and developed an essential sense of motivation. Moreover, I learned how actions are affected by the presence of those around us.</p>

				<p>2. Child development: through advanced graduate and independent studies, I learned how we develop the tendencies and behaviors that construct our identity. I also learned from work with elementary school students who had behavioral issues, how temperament and self-control develops.</p>

				<p>3. Human behavior: in my studies I learned how neurochemical and neuroanatomical features define the conscious and unconscious behavioral outcomes. I have been working with individuals that have autism and see the

				<h4>A problem begets a solution:</h4>
				<p>The problem was my interests did not narrow down. So, when I finished school, I decided to go to a social psychology conference to explore what research was going on- this was where it happened... I saw a booth recruiting UX researchers. Curious as usual, l looked up what this UX thing was, and I found my passion. I found a way to explore human behavior and needs in order to create a solution.</p>

				<h4>Work along the way:</h4>
				<p>Reseller e-commerce site: Redesigned by implementing a new narrative that directly addressed the niche clientele resulting in increased sales.  Focus became the seller as a brand, rather than the products.</p>

				<h4>Team projects:</h4>
				<p>Project TrayLAB: Co-team lead on this service design project that has been examining a concerted effort to shape DCPS school food by connecting parents and business stakeholders. This project seeks to redesign the process and effectiveness of sharing stakeholder needs through adjustments to the user journey and the website that is the point of contact outside in person meetings held quarterly.</p>
				<p>DC Design Hackathon: For this challenge I was on a team of three designers. We chose to design the opening screens for a meditation app with a milennial audience. The challenge laid in organizing access to a large amount of content with a user friendly style that was intuitive to the audience. </p>

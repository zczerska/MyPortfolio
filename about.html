I also learned from work with elementary school students who had behavioral issues, how temperament and self-control develops.</p>

So, when I finished school, I decided to go to a social psychology conference to explore what research was going on- this was where it happened... I saw a booth recruiting UX researchers. Curious as usual, l looked up what this UX thing was, and I found my passion. I found a way to explore human behavior and needs in order to create a solution.</p>

				<p>This project seeks to redesign the process and effectiveness of sharing stakeholder needs through adjustments to the user journey and the website that is the point of contact outside in person meetings held quarterly.</p>
				<p>DC Design Hackathon: For this challenge I was on a team of three designers. We chose to design the opening screens for a meditation app with a milennial audience. The challenge laid in organizing access to a large amount of content with a user friendly style that was intuitive to the audience. </p>
